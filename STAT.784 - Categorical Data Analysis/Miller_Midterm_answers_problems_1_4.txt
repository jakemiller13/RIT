Expected tickets per week: 128

H_0: lambda = 128
H_a: lambda > 128
z = 1.0 | critical z = 5.991
z is not greater than critical z, therefore not enough evidence to reject H_0.

# Problem 4 #

Original:
    Air  Bus  Car  Train
NY   28   50   35     47
NJ   24   11    7      8
CT   23   37   14      7

The analyst would like to understand the relationship between state and land vs. air, therefore I will combine the various land travel methods

Modified:
    Air  Land
NY   28   132
NJ   24    26
CT   23    58

Independence:
df          2
pvalue      7.761108112747106e-05
statistic   18.92760068587105
Small p, therefore there is an association between state and method of travel

Pearson Residuals:
         Air      Land
NY -2.061338  1.214655
NJ  3.095836 -1.824239
CT  0.464803 -0.273888
Large positive residual for NJ by air, large negative residual for NY by air.
Smaller positive residual for NY by land, smaller negative residual for NJ by land.
Minimal residuals for CT by either air or land.
Therefore, less people from New York and more people from New Jersey travelled by air than the hypothesis of independence predicts.
Similar for more people from New York traveling by land and less people from New Jersey.

Chi-squared: 18.93
With df = 2 and standard deviation of 2, this is well beyond right-hand tail (chi-squared for 2 degrees of freedom at alpha(0.05) = 5.99), therefore further evidence of association.

-- Recommendation --
The problem does not specify where the convention takes place, but based on the residuals, I will assume it takes place in New York.
This is based on the higher than expected land travel for people from New York, and higher than expected air travel for people from New Jersey.
I would therefore recommend that people traveling from New Jersey fly, people from New York travel by land, and folks from Connecticut can travel however they see fit.
